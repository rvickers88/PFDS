    "## What is the notebook style of programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **notebook  interface** or **computational  notebook** is a  type of\n",
    "programming   tool  that   enables  a   style  of   coding  known   as <a href=\"http://www.literateprogramming.com/\" target=\"_blank\">literate programming</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind literate programming is that the purpose, functionality and logic of a program are explained by means of natural language descriptions that are included with the actual source code of the program. In other words, the executable code of a program is shown with documentation of what it is for and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this kind of programming, we need a notebook file format and a programming environment that provides the means for displaying, editing, executing and viewing the output of notebook files. Typically, such a system would be built on top of an existing programming language by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* extending its file format to incorporate additional documenting information\n",
    "* providing a development tool that allows editing and display of this additional information as well as editing and execution of program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "In the case of Jupyter, the notebook is built on top of the Python language.\n",
    "The file format used by Jupyter is **IPython NoteBook**. Files in this format normally have file names ending in the extension `.ipynb` and will be referred to as `ipynb` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of `ipynb` files is primarily organised into two types of cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Python code cells__ contain code that is just like Python code that would be written in a non-notebook programming environment, although some code may contain commands that are specifically designed for use in notebooks (such as for displaying output in particular ways within the notebook)\n",
    "* __Markdown cells__ (like this one) contain textual information whose layout can be specified by the `markdown` notation, which enables formatting such as headers and bullet-point lists to be specified. These cells also allow the use of HTML formatting and allow hyperlinks and images to be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ipynb` files also contain some other information regarding properties of the file and outputs that have been generated by the code cells, but this is created automatically, not edited by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually several varieties of Jupyter notebook programming environment, but they are all very similar both in their appearance and functionality. These environments all have the following general properties and capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The interface is web-based. This means that the user normally interacts with the Jupyter programming environment via a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code execution and file storage are handled via a server, which is a separate program running either locally on the user's machine (for example, the Jupyter notebook server that comes with an Anaconda Python installation) or on a remote machine (for example, provided by a cloud-based service, such as Google's Colab).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code cells can be executed either individually one at a time in sequence, or all code in the notebook can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code output will be displayed below each code cell after it is run. The code output can also be enhanced by various formatting and graphical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When markdown cells are executed, they are rendered into the format specified by markdown notations within the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a wide variety of other commands such as: file loading and saving, cutting, pasting, searching, clearing output and restarting. These functions are provided by means of menus and hot-keys.\n",

    "The rest of this notebook will help you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks by leading you through how to create and run code cells. \n",

    "When this cell runs some output will appear below it and the next cell (in this case a Markdown cell) will be selected. You can also use ``shift+Enter`` to move past the Markdown cells. "
